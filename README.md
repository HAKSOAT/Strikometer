# Strikometer

Made by **Nigerian** students, for **Nigerian** students.
Due to the nation's struggling education sector, frequent strike actions are held by different associations that make up the university.
This is a way of making requests from the Federal Government.

However, the one that tells the biggest toll on the students remains the ASUU (Academic Staff Union of Universities) strike action.

Academic activities are put on hold and students stay at home for days, weeks and as seen in some cases months before strike action is called off.

The **Strikometer** was made to remind Nigerian students of the time spent on the strike action, encouraging them to get busy and learn new skills to make them better people.

This web application is currently hosted [here](https://strikometer.herokuapp.com) is open to contribution, as more features would be welcomed.
